# Jumping Corgi

## Background and Overview:

Jumping Corgi is a minigame where user will control 2 Corgis, trying to grab "energy" items (i.e. bones, cakes, sausages, etc.) to keep their health bar from depreciated.

Game play is fairly simple:

  * Game starts with 1 Corgi on the top standing bar, while the other one staying down at the seasaw.
  * User will control 1 Corgi at a time, using mouse movement.
  * User can toggle between Corgis, using defined key (tab?)
  * Energy items will appear randomly from either side of the screen, moving horizontally and disappear into the other side.
  * When ready to grab energy items, user will perform a click (or press spacebar) and the top Corgi will jump down. Landing on the seasaw will result in the other Corgi jumping back up, landing on the top standing bar.
  * Note: when the top Corgi lands on the seasaw, user will gain instant control over the other (jumping-up) Corgi.
  * Any energy item grabbed during the jumping up and down process, will contribute to Corgis team health bar, as well as the overall score.
  * The health bar will deplete over time.
  * Bonus items (optional): full health bar energy, double speed, etc.
