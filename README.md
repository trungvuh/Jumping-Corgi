# Jumping Shiba

## Background and Overview:

Jumping Shiba is a minigame where user will control 2 Shibas, trying to grab "energy" items (i.e. bones, cakes, sausages, etc.) to keep their health bar from depreciated.

Game play is fairly simple:

  * Game starts with 1 Shiba on the top standing bar, while the other one staying down at the seesaw.
  * User will control 1 Shiba at a time, using mouse movement.
  * User can toggle between Shibas, using defined key (tab?)
  * Energy items will appear randomly from either side of the screen, moving horizontally and disappear into the other side.
  * When ready to grab energy items, user will perform a click (or press spacebar) and the top Shiba will jump down. Landing on the seesaw will result in the other Shiba jumping back up, landing on the top standing bar.
  * Note: when the top Shiba lands on the seesaw, user will gain instant control over the other (jumping-up) Shiba.
  * Any energy item grabbed during the jumping up and down process, will contribute to Shibas team health bar, as well as the overall score.
  * The health bar will deplete over time.
  * Bonus items (optional): full health bar energy, double speed, etc.
